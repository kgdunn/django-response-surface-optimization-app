Hi there,

Thank you for joining the RSM (Response Surface Method) website.

It looks like your email address has never been used here before. So you will
need:

1. To click on this link to activate your account
   <a href="{{validation_URI}}">{{validation_URI}}</a>
2. Afterwards, you will choose a name for the leaderboards (we provide some suggestions)
3. That's it!

We don't use passwords on our website, but we do send you emails to verify
it is you running the experiments.

Hope you reach the optimum!
