Hi there,

Thank you for joining the RSM (Response Surface Method) website.


It looks like your email address has never been used here before. So you will need:

1. To click on this link to activate your account: <a href="{{validation_URI}}">{{validation_URI}}</a>
2. Afterwards, you will choose a name for the leaderboards (we provide some suggestions)
3. That's it!


<b>We don't use passwords on our website</b>, but we do send emails to make sure it is you running the experiments.


Hope you reach the optimum!
